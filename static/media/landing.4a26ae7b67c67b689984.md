Welcome! I’m Joshua Deering, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Ottawa building at the intersection of software and hardware. From designing circuit boards for Formula SAE and ESP32-powered haptics to developing Rust DSP tools, I enjoy turning complex ideas into physical reality. Away from my computer, you’ll find me on the volleyball court, snowboarding, or outdoors with a fresh cup of coffee.
