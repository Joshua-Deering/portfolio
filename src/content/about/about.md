Hi there! I'm Joshua Deering, an aspiring __Hardware/Embedded Engineer__ in my second year of Computer Engineering (CO-OP) at the University of Ottawa.

I am currently focusing on embedded systems and __PCB design__, as I enjoy the hands-on challenge of taking a project from a schematic to a functional device. Recently, this has involved designing __custom PCBs__ for the __uOttawa Formula SAE__ car and developing a [haptic scroll wheel](https://github.com/Joshua-Deering/Vertent) using an ESP32 to integrate haptic feedback and user interactability. I find the process of refining a design from initial architecture to the final revision to be one of the most rewarding aspects of engineering.

This interest in hardware is closely tied to my background in __Audio Engineering__. Having spent a lot of time managing sound and troubleshooting audio systems, I've developed quite an appreciation for all that goes into reliable and complete signal chains. This also lead to another project of mine, [Octave](https://github.com/Joshua-Deering/Octave), which is a deep dive into __Digital Audio__ and __Digital Signal Processing__ as well as audio visualization.

When I’m away from the workbench, I’m usually staying active - whether that’s on the volleyball court, on a snowboard, or exploring the outdoors through camping and road trips. I am also an avid coffee lover and enjoy the creative process of cooking at home.

I’m always looking for new ways to blend systems engineering with creative hardware solutions. Feel free to explore my work!
